No announcements were made.

### Approval of the agenda

The main agenda points for this meeting were discussed last time already (doing the teamwork assignment, creating a draft backlog).

### Approve minutes of prior meeting

This will be done on 15.02 collectively with the minutes of this meeting.

### Teamwork assigment 1B - Purpose: getting an idea of the team dynamics/team roles.

We collected the Belbin roles and discussed possible resulting weaknesses and strengths of our team. During this meeting assignment 1B was almost finished, the rest is to be done remotely.

### Draft backlog - Purpose: overview of tasks.

The backlog was drafted using the MoSCoW method (with the variant of W being “Would”) to create an overview of the importance of each individual task at hand. We collected our notes from the Client Q&A.

### Platform for shared documents - Purpose: planning.

We decided to use Google Docs for sharing documents (e.g. concerning assignments such as the teamwork assignment).
