## Agenda items

### Announcements/Approval of the agenda/Approve minutes of prior meeting

Since this meeting is the first group meeting, these items were not necessary. Primarily, the main goal of this meeting is to get to know each other and to get an overview of the upcoming tasks.

### Introduction of team members - Purpose: getting to know each other.

Every team member shortly introduced themselves. 

### How are things going? - Purpose: general check-in.

Short discussion about the previous quarters and how the subjects went for everyone.

### Discuss the assignment - Purpose: get an overview of next tasks.

Discussion of the upcoming tasks. Assignments that are due this week are the **Git assignment** (individually, due Friday) and **teamwork assignment 1**. 
There is also the possibility to create a **draft backlog**.  The teamwork assignment is composed of two parts, one individual part and one group part. It is due Friday at 18:00. We decided to meet again later during the week to do the second part as a team.
The task of each team member is to do the Belbin personality test until then, so that we can collect all roles that are represented in our group. (See action points.)
Also, it is important to pay attention during the Client Q&A (Wednesday, 09.02) so that we can collect tasks for the draft backlog.

### Discuss time and place of next meeting - Purpose: planning.

**Next meeting:** 10.02, 11 am, at the library in reserved project room or online (hybrid)\
**Planned duration:** 1 hour
