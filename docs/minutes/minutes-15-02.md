### Approval of the agenda/Approve minutes of prior meeting

These were already approved before this meeting.

### How are things going? & Tip/tops last week - Purpose: Check-in.

Short general discussion how things are going at the moment regarding the past and future assignments (Git assignment, Teamwork assignment, deadlines etc.).
We came to the conclusion that it is a bit hard to find out when to finish what because the deadlines are in different places.
During group meetings we discuss when we have to finish what to get a better overview.

### Code of Conduct - Purpose: discuss.

We decided to do the Code of Conduct on Thursday: See announcements at the end.

### Backlog - Purpose: feedback, check what is to be done regarding the backlog.

**Feedback**
- Division into categories (must, should etc.) and coverage is fine
- Rewrite each point to two sentences (must define the requirement concretely)
  - Reading this should give a clear idea and definition of the task
  - e.g. "Quiz application" is too broad, is not a clear definition of a smaller task

**To do**
- Rewrite the individual tasks (more specific)
- Push the backlog to GitLab: Create issues for each of the points

### Miscellaneous topics - Purpose: discuss.

**Checkstyle**
- Add to the XML file and use a plugin in Intellij
  - Add on own IDE, and to pipeline on GitLab

**When is an issue closed?**

- Checkstyle was run
- Possibilities regarding testing:
  1. Have issues related to testing in general (separate issues)
  2. Add testing to a checklist inside an issue (this checklist should be used also for other tasks than testing)
- It is possible to add dependencies between issues
- You can add tags to issues (e.g. started)

**Testing**

- **Decision:** Test as we go, if something is finished, it should be tested
- **To do for the future:** Think about what coverage of testing we want to have (e.g. 80% coverage of classes)

**Agenda/minutes branch**
- **Decision:** should be merged every Monday
