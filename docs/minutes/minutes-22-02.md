# Team meeting - 22.02

Location: Drebbelweg/online (hybrid)\
Date: 22.02.2022\
Time: 16:45 - 17:45\
Attendees: Damla Ortaç (TA), Tereza Ležovičová, Erik Vidican, Filip Błaszczyk, Gijs van der Heide, Tadas Lukavičius, Fanni Fiedrich

### Opening by Chairperson 

### Announcements

* Information Literacy - Did everyone start yet? 

### Approval of the agenda
Approved beforehand.

### Approve minutes of prior meeting
Approved.

### Check-in and discussion regarding code template.
Did everyone go over the code template?
  * No problems concerning the code template arose.

Checkstyle rules
  * Tereza implements the checkstyle rules before we start coding (see action points).

### Code of conduct.
Rubric points -> adjust code of conduct.

* Assignment description, good general description, but there's no overview of the tasks. The outside reader must be able to understand what we are doing.

* Target or ambition, add something not grade related describing end goal of course.

* Product, there are no clear deliverables, to the client at end of project, source code etc. There must also be standrads on this project. E.g. Certain testing coverage, type of coverage, more concrete mentioning of what we are expecting standard-wise.

* Planning -> division of work, what do we focus on equal amount of time or equal amount of issues etc. And setting deadlines.

* Behaviour -> mention that every member needs to work on every part of the code.

* Mention when TA will intervene for deadlines.

* Commitments -> mention measurements, what is quality of work. Everyone approves the work, or one person, etc. Qualtiy of chairman and note taker.

* Meetings -> How do we arrange meetings (set date?). Do we cancel/postpone meetings? What is the goal of these meetings? In case the scheduled meetings aren't enough, how do we schedule new meetings?

* Decision making, specify what happens in case of no consensus

* Consequences, in case someone didn't meet a deadline, concrete consequences. Constructive consequences, e.g. why didn't you meet the deadline, do you need help? If this happens more often, when do we go to TA?

* Dream team -> more concrete?

Submit new code of conduct via GitLab.

### API Endpoints
GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE on an endpoint. We need to have one working endpoint. Temperature function of weather application is also an endpoint.

### Backlog feedback
Keep playing around with subtasks and issues, but is fine right now.

### Good GitLab practices
Consider using the board: In progress, in review, in testing, instead of only open/closed. Not mandatory, but nice feature.

Allocate 1-2 people per issue, if more needed, split the issue up! More people are not recommended.

Create more smaller issues/subtasks. Even very basic ones, like create this and this Class etc.

Use time tracker.

Merge requests: TA can get weekly report. Leave (constructive!) comments on merge requests! It is important to first comment and then approve, and not just approve.

First pull dev before merge request, resolve the merge conflicts locally. Then the dev pipeline doesn't break! Not sure if applicable if we are not going to use a dev branch? Or do we want to use a dev branch?

Small commits are considered better style, it is easy to make mistakes in big chunks of code. Break your coding steps into small commits to ensure that everything works as intended.

### Summary of action points

|Action items|Who is responsible|Deadline|
|---|---|---|
|API endpoint|Gijs|Friday|
|Checkstyle|Tereza|Next week (before start of coding)|
|Evaluate design of other team|Everyone individually|Wednesday evening|
|Code of Conduct (adjusted version)|Everyone (team meeting)|Saturday|
|HCI assignment in general|Everyone (team meeting)|Friday|

### Any questions?

Use the 10 heuristics from the HCI lecture. If necessary, not needed heuristics can be removed, but it is better to consider all.
Use the resources e.g. in the conclusion or to explain why certain UI features were implemented in that way.

### Announcements

Next team meeting is on Thursday. Then we will discuss the specific division of tasks for the HCI assignment and plan our approach. Also, the Code of Conduct should be discussed then.
